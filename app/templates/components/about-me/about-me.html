<div class="about-me">
    <p>
        I am the <strong>{{aboutMe.name}}</strong> component. I'm also scaffolded into <strong>app/components</strong>. Noogie scaffolds all component bundles into this directory!
    </p>
    <p>
        Noogie also auto-links JS and Sass(CSS) dependencies in their proper locations in index.html and main.scss to make things easy!
